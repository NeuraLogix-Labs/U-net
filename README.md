## Introduction

Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves labeling each pixel in an image with a corresponding class. This script showcases the training process of a U-Net model, a popular architecture for semantic segmentation tasks.

## Features

- Configurable number of training epochs.
- Adjustable learning rate for optimization.
- Easy integration with custom datasets.
- Demonstrates the use of the Dice Loss for semantic segmentation.
- Supports both CPU and GPU training.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/semantic-segmentation-script.git


## Usage

To train the U-Net model using the script, follow these steps:

1-Prepare your dataset (see Dataset).
2-Adjust the hyperparameters in the script if needed.
3-Run the script:

```
python train.py --num_epoch NUM_EPOCHS --lr LEARNING_RATE --model_name MODEL_NAME.pth

```

## Dataset

The training script uses the 'Dataset_Train' class to load and preprocess the training data. Make sure to implement this class according to your dataset's structure and requirements. You can customize transformations for images and labels as needed.


## Model

The U-Net model is defined in the 'Unet' class. Feel free to modify this architecture or substitute it with a different model based on your project's needs.

## Loss Function
The script utilizes the 'JACARD LOSS 'for training the model. Other loss functions suitable for semantic segmentation can also be explored.

## Training
The training loop iterates through batches of data, computes predictions, calculates loss, and updates model weights. Training progress is displayed using the tqdm library.

## Results
The script currently focuses on the training process. You can extend it to save model checkpoints, visualize training curves, and evaluate the model on a test set.
